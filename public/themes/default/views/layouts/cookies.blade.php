<h5>What?</h5>
<p>In practice, this means that a small text file is stored in your browser when you use the site.</p>
<p>In this case, the files only contain unique identifiers, which means that I'm able to recognize a returning reader as being the same person that has visited previously.</p>

<h5>Why?</h5>
<p>The cookies on this site are only used for analytics purposes, via <a href="http://piwik.org" target="_blank">Piwik</a>.</p>
<p>This affords me insights about the visitors, and what they read.</p>

<h5>Who?</h5>
<p>As Piwik is a self-hosted tool, the cookies in question are never shared with any third party.</p>
